            <h3 class="feature-header">Empowering Small to Medium-Sized Charities and Not For Profits to Thrive</h3>
            <p class="feature-text">
                In the heart of every small to medium-sized charity or not for profit (NFP) organisation, there's a
                mission to make the world a better place.
                However, even the most passionate teams can find themselves tangled in the web of administrative tasks,
                fundraising challenges, and the struggle to make every penny count. Not wanting to spend money on
                expensive
                software, fundraising and donor data storage can end up in spreadsheets in a
                shared location, at risk of security breaches or being deleted by mistake.</p>

                less time for what truly

            <p class="about-text">
                As a start up the partners of Elastic Mint offered pro bono services to a local Bristol Charity. The
                Charity had just been through a operational review resulting in one of their objectives to install a
                CRM. The Charity couldn't find an existing product with the features they needed for an affordable
                price. Budget restraints for small charities have to be adhered to and legal restrictions make it
                impossible to spend more than 30% of income on running costs without significant justification.
            </p>
            <br />

                Elastic Mint have continued to support the Charity and to develop their product further to extend its

                enabling
                all sizes of not for profit and charitable organisations to realise the importance of a CRM at an
                acceptable
